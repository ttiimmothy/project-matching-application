# Authentication Microservice

- The authentication microservice is responsible for creating users.
- A user that creates an account automatically becomes a buyer in the application.
- When a user successfully creates an account, an event is published from the `authentication service` to the `users service` so as to add buyer data to `mongodb`.
- Server side errors from the authentication microservice is sent to `elasticsearch` and can be viewed on `kibana`.
- Authentication service uses these tools as the main tools
  - `Your shared library`
  - `NodeJS`
  - `Express`
  - `Typescript`
  - `Rabbitmq`
  - `Elasticsearch`
  - `MySQL database`
  - `Sequelize`
  - `Json web token`
  - `Faker to create seed data`
- There are other packages that are used.
- You can update the version of `NodeJS` used inside the `Dockerfile` and `Dockerfile.dev`.
- Make sure you already have your own shared library published.
- Copy the `.npmrc` file from your shared library folder and replace `${NPM_TOKEN}` with the actual `personal access token` you created.
- Once you have your `.npmrc` and before you run `npm install` command, replace all occurrences of `@uzochukwueddie/jobber-shared` with your own shared library.
- After replacing all occurrences of `@uzochukwueddie/jobber-shared`, you can then run `npm install` command.
- Copy contents of `.env.dev` to `.env` file
  - Create an account on <https://cloudinary.com>
  - Get your `cloud name`, `cloud secret` and `cloud api key` and add to `.env`
  - You can generate a new `GATEWAY_JWT_TOKEN` and `JWT_TOKEN`
    - Just note that whatever you generate, that is what you will need to use in all the microservices that require those variables.
- You can start the service with `npm run dev`.

- You can create your own docker image from this microservice.
- Create an account on <https://hub.docker.com> or login if you already have one.
- Make sure to login on your terminal as well.
